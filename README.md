# Matrix Slim

> Attention: This keyboard is in developement and the pcb is not yet functional.

This is the successor to my original Matrix keyboard. It's point is to be slimmer using the new low footprint kailh switches, to get closer to the macbook keyboard feel.

I was inspired by the mikefive keyboard that is only 5mm thick. However, for a split version we cannot mount a nice!nano and battery next to eachother. This is why I decided to directly recreate the microchip on the board. Note that this is my first time designing a pcb with a microchip and ot may have some errors / bad design.
